								<h1>Rooftop Solar-Panel Cleaning Device</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p>This project presents an automated rooftop solar panel cleaning device tailored for residential and commercial solar arrays. It addresses the critical challenge of performance degradation due to dust accumulation, offering an effective, low-maintenance, and scalable solution. The device uses a brush-based cleaning mechanism integrated with motion control and a smartphone app interface. It operates autonomously without disrupting panel alignment or power generation, and is optimized for rooftops with inclines between 15–30 degrees. A scale-model prototype was developed and tested to evaluate cleaning efficiency, structural integrity, and system autonomy.</p>

										<h2>Project Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The project aims to design and develop a cost-effective and efficient cleaning device for rooftop solar panels, primarily to combat the performance losses caused by dust and dirt accumulation. Manual cleaning methods pose significant drawbacks including labor intensiveness, high costs, and safety risks. While commercial automated solutions exist, they tend to be expensive and often difficult to integrate into existing residential systems. This project’s goal was to develop a lightweight, modular, and user-friendly automated cleaner that operates autonomously, minimizes water usage, and communicates with users via a mobile application. The final device is designed for easy deployment on inclined rooftops without altering the existing solar panel setup.</p>

												<h3>Design Requirements </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Cleaning Performance: Remove fine dust/debris without damaging the panel surface using soft-bristle brushes.

Autonomy: Operate with minimal human interaction, controlled via app or set timer.

Structural Integrity: Light enough (less than 10 kg) to avoid stressing solar mounts, yet stable under wind loads.

Energy & Water Efficiency: Low power consumption and minimal water usage.

Safety: Waterproof, weather-resistant housing with electrical insulation; system halts during servicing.

Durability: Service life of at least 10 years with minimal maintenance.

User Interface: Notification system for operation completion or errors; intuitive mobile app control.

Compatibility: Adaptable to varying panel sizes and arrangements; non-intrusive to energy generation.

Compliance: Meets safety, environmental, and legal standards.

Cost Target: Selling price ≈ RM 5K; manufacturing cost ≤ 40% of selling price.</p>

												<h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Extensive research identified dust as a major factor reducing solar panel efficiency by 20–30%. Manual cleaning solutions were deemed hazardous and impractical for regular use. A thorough literature review and patent study helped identify the gaps in existing cleaning systems—mainly high cost, inefficiency, and abrasive methods. Conceptual design was guided by functional decomposition and morphological analysis, leading to 18 ideas. These were evaluated using weighted criteria such as cost, efficiency, safety, and manufacturability. Final concept selection favored a brush-based device that moves on tracks, powered by lightweight motors, with app-controlled scheduling. The chosen concept emphasized environmental sustainability, structural compatibility, and ease of use.</p>

												<h3>Final Result</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The final prototype features a motorized cleaning unit with soft rotating brushes mounted on lightweight tracks that glide over the solar panel frames. The system includes sensors for motion control, an onboard microcontroller, and wireless connectivity for app-based operation. Designed for rooftops with inclines of 15–30°, the device cleans in efficient paths without pausing or stuttering. The structure is weatherproof, resistant to dust and water ingress, and uses recyclable materials. Cleaning cycles take under 20 minutes, after which the system sends a completion notification. The device is modular, allowing easy installation and component replacement, and is engineered to avoid interference with panel performance or structure.</p>
