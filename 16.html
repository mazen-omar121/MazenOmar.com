								<h1>Sustainable Low Head River Dam Implementation for Water Quality</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p>This project focuses on revitalizing a stagnant river near the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia by implementing a sustainable low-head dam (weir) system. With the primary issues being low dissolved oxygen levels and minimal flow, the dam design integrates aeration mechanisms to boost aquatic health and water circulation. Anchored in Malaysia’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and aligned with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water), the initiative incorporates green manufacturing techniques and proposes accompanying policies for long-term environmental resilience.</p>

										<h2>Project Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The Sustainable Low Head River Dam project aims to address declining water quality in the river adjacent to Block E07, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, UTM. The river has shown signs of stagnation and low dissolved oxygen levels, making it less habitable for aquatic life and prone to mosquito breeding. Through extensive research on weirs, aeration strategies, and green practices relevant to SDG 6 and SDG 14, a prototype dam was conceptualized. The design emphasizes natural aeration via hydraulic jumps, aiming to elevate dissolved oxygen content while maintaining consistent water flow. In parallel, a green policy framework was suggested to ensure ongoing maintenance and integration with larger water sustainability strategies in Malaysia.</p>

												<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Water Aeration: Raise dissolved oxygen levels from 4.73 mg/L to above 6.5 mg/L to meet Class 1 water quality standards.

Flow Rate Control: Reduce stagnation and encourage continuous flow to prevent mosquito breeding and water quality decline.

Sustainability: Utilize green manufacturing principles and materials.

Adaptability: Fit into the existing river geometry without drastic ecological disruption.

SDG Alignment: Support both SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).

Policy Integration: Include a long-term strategy for policy-driven maintenance and scalability.</p>

												<h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The project began by analyzing water samples and identifying critical shortcomings—namely, near-threshold pH levels and low dissolved oxygen. Recognizing that mechanical aeration was energy-intensive and less sustainable, the team turned to passive aeration strategies involving low-head dam (weir) designs. A series of designs—triangular, rectangular, and piano key weirs—were evaluated for their aeration efficiency. Research findings from both international and Malaysian case studies highlighted triangular weirs and piano key weirs as especially effective in promoting air entrainment and oxygenation. The design also took cues from successful Malaysian green water management projects, such as integrated weirs in paddy irrigation and Langat River restoration. Finally, policy recommendations were crafted to accompany the physical design, addressing stakeholder roles, monitoring systems, and community engagement.</p>

												<h3>Final Result</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The final prototype is a modular low-head dam system featuring a triangular notch weir to maximize oxygenation through natural flow turbulence. Built with locally sourced, sustainable materials, the dam induces hydraulic jumps that entrain air and elevate dissolved oxygen downstream. It includes sediment bypass features and modular fish passages to support aquatic biodiversity. Policy recommendations support regular water quality monitoring, public-private collaboration, and scalable replication in other low-flow urban rivers. The design is adaptable, low-cost, and energy-efficient—making it ideal for sustainable campus and community water restoration.</p>
